        <p>
          This React-based Patient Portal Web App allows patients and doctors to log in via a secure dashboard. 
          It reduces reliance on physical records by storing data on a JSON server. Admins can perform CRUD operations,
          while patients have access to their personal details using a secure unique ID. The project focuses on front-end 
          design and data fetching using React.

    <p>
      This full-stack Bike Service Station Booking Platform allows users to register, book services, and track booking status through a responsive React.js frontend and a Node.js backend. MongoDB stores customer and service data using well-structured Mongoose schemas. Users can log in, book services, and track statuses like pending, ready for delivery, and completed. The backend provides secure API endpoints and integrates seamlessly with the frontend. The project structure includes separate folders for client (React), server (Node), and schema files. Key technologies include Axios, React Bootstrap, and React Router. The app ensures a smooth user experience for managing bike service bookings.

    <p>
      The Smart Metering System using IoT is an advanced energy monitoring solution that combines ESP32, current and voltage sensors to track real-time power usage. Data is transmitted to Firebase, enabling users to access detailed usage stats via a mobile app. The app provides visual dashboards, consumption alerts, billing estimates, and historical trends. Users can monitor energy in kWh and manage costs efficiently. The system emphasizes security with encrypted cloud storage and user authentication. It also supports threshold-based alerts to avoid high bills. With automated billing, analytics, and scalability for AI and renewable integration, this solution enhances modern energy management. Future upgrades include smart grid support and predictive features.
